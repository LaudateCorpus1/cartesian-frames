# Cartesian Frames in HOL

This repository contains a (work-in-progress) formalisation in
[HOL](https://hol-theorem-prover.org) of the results in [Cartesian Frames sequence](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/2A7rrZ4ySx6R8mfoT).

The proofs have been checked to build with the [Kananaskis-14 release](https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL/releases/tag/kananaskis-14) of HOL4.
